## Who Am I?
My name is Henry, I'm a 22 year old soon-to-be graduate of the University of Michigan. I grew up
in New York City and left the east coast to experience the charm of midwest. I am
interested in making people's lives easier through technology. My academic and professional
background combines user experience, graphic design and software engineering. Currently
I work as a Software Engineer at [Nutshell], building a CRM for small-to-medium businesses.
In August, I will begin working as a Software Engineer at [Sprout Social] in Chicago!

If you want to learn more about my work, take a look at my [portfolio] or [github profile][github].

## Why Do I Blog?
In the field of Software Engineering, there can often be challenges with communicating technical ideas
to one another. I am starting to blog to get more comfortable breaking down complex concepts and
as a way to document my personal adventures in technology. Right now, I am documenting my experience
of learning a new web technology, React, from start to finish.
