There is a trend that I find concerning in the tech world. It’s the popularity of dropping out. Droves of former students are leaving school, both college and high school, to work technology jobs and start companies. It feels like there is a gold rush going on in the tech world. Younger people feel like they’re missing out by “wasting time” taking classes that do not seem to pertain to their desired career. And since programming can be [self-taught], it is possible to start your career without having formal education.

Personally, I find this trend to be somewhat concerning. While there are a number of valid reasons to take this path, it should be the exception not the rule. Successful dropouts like Bill Gates that are used to legitimize this trend have [actively discouraged people from dropping out].

In a time where a college degree does not even guarantee strong job prospects, it does not seem like having less credentials is the right direction. Many proponents of dropping out say otherwise. The belief that “college is not for everyone” does hold validity, but it is important for alternatives to provide similar challenges. The persistence and hard work required to complete a college degree illustrate certain qualities to employers. It is important to find other ways to show these essential abilities if one chooses not to pursue college.

For people that are trying to juggle a growing business with college. It is worth taking a leave of absence to give it a shot. Or if one is putting oneself in immense debt as a student and receives a great job offer in one’s desired field, it is definitely worth pursuing too. However, dropping out without any sort of compelling opportunity seems like a mistake.

There are many consequences to choosing not to complete your education that will impact you later in life. While some of the useful skills you use as a software engineer are not taught in school, the foundation provided by a good education enables you to be well versed in a number of disciplines. Getting a formal education is not necessarily about the application of what you’re learning in classes, but learning how to learn and think critically (and write great blog posts). Additionally, the lack of a college or high school degree make it difficult for future job prospects or something like getting a mortgage.

And the biggest risk I see for these folks is what might happen if the [tech bubble bursts]. If tons of developers are out of a job, there’s a huge risk for young people without degrees to be the first to be struggling to get hired at a more traditional company. This threat is something that is deserving of it’s own post, so more on that later.

Ultimately, people will make their own path. I have no right to legislate other people’s choices. I merely want other young people to think hard about the decision to leave school behind. It’s only four years. At our age, that might seem like a long time, but in the scheme of things it will only be a microcosm of our lives.
