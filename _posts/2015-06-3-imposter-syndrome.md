Originally, I was going to write this week about my progress on learning React, but I want to write about a problem that has impaired me, many other software developers and working people throughout the world. The problem I am speaking of is known as **Imposter syndrome**.

Wikipedia defines it as “a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.” Basically, it causes successful people to be plagued with a lack of confidence in their abilities.

Many people who feel this believe that one day their coworkers will discover that they are not as smart as they thought and their career will be over. This emerges in many other contexts when people who are way smarter than I ever could imagine struggle to accept how successful they are and still believe that they are not truly as amazing as everyone else believes. Not only is this damaging to one’s self esteem, it can be damaging to one’s career when other people take advantage

In the field of web development, I feel overwhelmed by all changing technology that is emerging every year. It feels like there is a constant struggle to keep up. There’s a fear that if you don’t you will run the risk of being outdated and relegated to boring corporate jobs. For me, I worry that I will not be able to successfully do the work at this job. What if I start working and they realize they made a mistake hiring me? In reality, I don’t think this will be the case, but there is a nagging fear in the back of my mind that it could happen.

How do we battle this problem? I have seen many talented people that are perfectly qualified for success fall victim to imposter syndrome. Many people take advantage of this lack of confidence, so it is essential to find a way to prevent it from crippling talented folks. I think that encouraging feedback from your peers is a good way to start. For me, getting honest opinions of your work helps you realize whether you are doing well or are truly faking it. People often do not want to confront others, but this only leads to detrimental results if it is not deal with as soon as possible. (Boz)[http://boz.com/articles/give-hard-feedback-fast.html] of Facebook fame inspired this point by his blog post on the subject of feedback. I think that not only is feedback helpful in making you a better person, but it can help mitigate imposter syndrome by reinforcing the good work that someone is doing.
