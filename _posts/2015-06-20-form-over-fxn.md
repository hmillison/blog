A constant frustration I find often on the web is when something is well designed, but fails in usability. If the visitor to a website is unable to find the information they want or do what they want to do, there is a serious problem. No matter how aesthetically pleasing it is, there is no point if the intended goal of the website is too difficult to achieve by the user. With how many websites exist on the internet, getting users to yours is difficult enough. If you want to keep them there, focusing on the user experience is essential.

The surprising thing is that there are countless examples of well known technology companies that make it easy for people to use their application. Take [Netflix] as an example. While many people love using it, the way they organize their library does not make it easy to search for what you want. The user is presented with a weird selection of categories that are meant to be personalized to them. To make things worse, to see the full list one has to do this unnatural side scrolling action and watch the movies move across the screen. There is no reason to require users to perform an unusual interaction when there are many that users are accustomed to through years of using computers. Typical movie categories are hidden from the user. And it is impossible to view popular or highly rated selections in their collection.

In their [latest design update] Netflix did not make any changes to these problems! They only made things look a little nicer and added fancier animations. And in some ways made things worse. Now you have to click on the edges of the lists to see more selections. It’s become even harder to browse. I will never understand how a company like this does not realize the difficulty it causes users. It is so bad that websites like [instantwatcher] provides a better interface to browse Netflix’s own collection. While instantwatcher does not look as fancy or modern as the main Netflix web application, it makes it easy to effectively browse their collection.

The user experience (UX) field is an underappreciated one. They are the primary advocate for the user in the development process. For managers, it can seem like a cost center since the value of it is not as tangible. The bells and whistles of a new design update appeal much more than doing usability studies to identify the problems that users are having with your system. The iterative process of UX can be time consuming, but the outcome ensures that the stakeholders in a business will be able to successfully provide users with the best possible experience.

Thanks to taking classes about UX, usability research and interaction design at the University of Michigan, I have become more aware of the pitfalls that can hurt a web application. This gives me more understanding of the user’s perspective in the development process. I think it is essential that awareness of issues becomes more widespread. Developers can feel so far removed from the users they are building something for, often having no understanding of how the application is actually used. Bridging the gap to give them a better idea of how best to make their customers lives easier will be the best for the long run.
