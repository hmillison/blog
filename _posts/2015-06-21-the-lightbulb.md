The process that leads you to that aha moment is one of the driving motivations in programming for me. All those moments of frustration and confusion culminate in excitement when you finally get things working. This is how it felt when I finally figured out React last week.

I was in the middle of watching an episode from the latest season of [Orange is the New Black] (which is a really great show) and stumbled onto a [React tutorial] posted by a friend of mine. This resource proved to provide me with the moment of clarity that finally helped me understand how it all fit together.

The inner workings of React are incredibly exciting to me now. The way that it allows me to abstract the [DOM] (document object model), which represents the structure of the webpage, into JavaScript. This enables me to more efficiently couple data with the user interface. Additionally, it allows you to focus on just JavaScript by structuring the DOM with it instead of with HTML. This process makes an application more performant through its ease in updating on changes in data.

Building something with React has been one of the most enjoyable processes of working with the front-end. It makes things incredibly simple to get working. The structure of each component enables you to make more sense of what everything is. And through the organization of subcomponents, it gives an easier understanding of how everything connects together.

I am building a simple todo app called checklist to get some experience working with React. This seems to be a classic example application for web technologies due to its simplicity to make and the usefulness of it. While there are tutorials available to do this, I chose to work from scratch, taking tips from the aforementioned tutorial and React’s documentation. This gave me the satisfaction of completing a project with a newfound comfort in building something in React. I’m already planning my next project!

In addition to using React. This app uses [Firebase] to handle the data. Firebase makes it easy for a front-end developer to
manage data in a simple app like this. It also enables updates to the todo list to be done collaboratively in realtime!


Check out the app here: [checklist] I am going to be making incremental updates on it in the future, but I am pretty pleased with
the result so far!

It looks like it's been exactly a month since my first post about getting started with React. I am excited to see this project come
full circle. This will not be the end of my blog though. I look forward to sharing my experiences and musings on the technology
in the future.
